# Tera, the Tax Collector [0.10.0]

Get ready to collect some payments as your wimpy tax collector charges everyone around him. Play with a new status effect: TAX! For every 3 tax a ship has, they
take one damage, and it does not decrease at the end of the turn! Play defensively to stack lots of tax, or spend tax to play more offensively!

Watch out, though. Many of Tera's cards also come with hefty debuffs to your own ship. Can you survive the onslaught of debuffs, or will you use BAILOUT to 
prevent those debuffs in the first place?

NOTE: THIS MOD REQUIRES BOTH NICKEL AND KOKORO TO FUNCTION PROPERLY.

Hey, so uh, I'm not sure what else to write here. Congrats on reading this!

Huge thanks to these people. I couldn't have made this mod without them.

* **ceresgalax** - The wonderful coder who spent hours working with me to get things right.
* **DukeFerret** - The sprite artist! He made all of those Tera sprites that match the vanilla game.
* **Arin** - The other sprite artist and first beta-tester. Arin made the artifact sprites, and also let me rant to them constantly about balance ideas.

Tera is still NOT finished! We still have more dialogue to add, card art, and some MEMORIES to add! I want him to feel like a vanilla character :)

Also devs if you're reading this hi hello please do not murder me I just like the funny animal game

Most importantly, have fun! Please send any feedback my way! <3
